ðŸ¦€ Rust Live: Self-Improving AI ðŸ¦€

### What is this?

Background: `gpt-4o-mini` is insane. It has a huge 128k-token context window, gives decent responses, and is _nearly free_.

Projecting into the future, expect LLMs to get strongly better on all three of these axes. There is an opportunity to design significantly new software development and intelligence workflows â€” not just simple evolutions. This project is an effort to do that.

Current status: ChatGPT-like interface as a Rust desktop app, growing into a more comprehensive tool and workflow.

### Principles

- **AI is Fundamental**: AI is eating the world even more than its most enthusiastic promoters realize. Overuse AI.
- **LLM Progression**: Expect continuous and dramatic advancements in LLM capabilities. Skate to where the puck is going to be.
- **Open Source Everything**: Open source isn't just about free, it's about authentic broadcasting, community-building, and revolution. It is a form of praxis.

### Strategies

- **Self-Improving Loop**: Develop a tool designed to enhance its own capabilities, analogous to "turning attention back on itself".
- **Chat-Interface**: Create "simulation of collaboration", hacking human neurology to motivate action.
- **User-Centric Tool**: Focus on personal utility, with enhancements based on genuine needs and desires derived from immediate experiences. This is also based on the ephemeral felt-sense.
- **Livestream Process**: Communicate the journey to connect with others and foster collaboration.
- **Aim High**: Focus on the deep insight.

**Tactics:**

- **Technology Stack**: Use Rust, egui, and Turbosql to provide a compelling playground.
- **Desktop-Only**: Mobile and web are a red herring.
- **To-Do List**: Good ideas, seeded by actual desires of using the process.
- **Design for Simplicity**: Make it easy to iterate.
- **Whole-File Code Suggestions**: To bootstrap activation energy.

### Good Ideas To-Do List:

- Finish this explanation, push it to GitHub, link it from Twitch, start streaming.
- Experiment with game creation with egui-tetra
- Dynamic update of README.md
